# Stock-Forcasting
## Overview  

This project aims to forecast future stock prices using machine learning techniques. It utilizes historical stock data, and potentially other relevant features, to train a predictive model. The core of the project is implemented to provide a clear and reproducible workflow for data analysis, model training, and price prediction. The goal is to provide insights into potential future stock movements to aid in investment decisions.
